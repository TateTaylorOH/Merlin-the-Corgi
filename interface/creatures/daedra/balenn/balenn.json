    "name": "BALENN",
    "description": "The Balenn is a primordial Daedric force that embodies the three main elements of magic: fire, frost, and shock. In their true form they exist in an incorporeal elemental state that has no clear shape.\n\nHowever, Balenn have the ability to shift between several different forms; most choose to live in the form of an animal. These forms vary between Balenn, but some of the most common include wolves, foxes, cats, and dogs. Balenn are generally docile and friendly, although if startled they will make short work of their assailant."
