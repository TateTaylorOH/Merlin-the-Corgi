    "name": "BALENN",
    "description": "The Balenn is a primordial Daedric force that embodies the three primary elements of magic: fire, frost, and shock. In their true form, they exist in an incorporeal elemental state that has no clear shape.\n\nBalenn have the ability to shift between several different forms, though most choose to assume the forms of animals, such as wolves, foxes, cats, and dogs. Balenn are generally friendly and docile, but will make short work of their assailant if startled."
